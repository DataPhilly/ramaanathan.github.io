[Multi Variate Analysis](https://ramaanathan.github.io/PSU_STAT505_MVA/)
- Examples from [Penn State University's course on Multi Variate Analysis](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat505/) re-implemented in R

[Bike Rental - ANCOVA](/pdf/BikeRental_AncovaAnalysis.pdf)<br>
- This was an observational study of a [public dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)  to model the various factors that influence hourly bike rental. Three different models were compared – an ANOVA model, an ANCOVA model assuming no interaction between the covariate and the other factors, and a second ANCOVA model with interactions between the covariate and two of the factors. The third model was found to show significant group effects. 

[Survival Analysis of TCGA Breast Cancer Data](https://ramaanathan.github.io/SurvivalAnalysis/)
- [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga), a joint effort between the National Cancer Institute and the Human Genome Research Institute, provides publicly-available clinical and high-throughput genomic data for thirty-three different types of cancers. This rich data source is widely used by researchers and has led to vast improvements in diagnosing, treating, and preventing cancer. The TCGA clinical dataset is used in this study to do survival analysis of breast cancer (BRCA) by considering demographic and cancer staging (T,M,N stages) variables as predictors.

### Data Visualizations
- [Visualizations using Highcharts and Highmaps](https://ramaanathan.github.io/HighchartViz/)<br>
These charts are examples from the [HighCharts Demo website](https://www.highcharts.com/demo). Here, I have played around with the custom themes to give the charts a different look.
